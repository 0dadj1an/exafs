# FlowSpec Exafs tool

FlowSpec Exafs is a tool for creation, validation, and execution 
of [ExaBGP messages](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp).
It provides two interfaces - the Web app and the REST API. Both combined with user 
authentication mechanism, access control system and message validation system. 

The toolset was created and tested at the Technical University of Liberec for CESNET by Jiri Vrany, Petr Adamec, and Josef Verich.
